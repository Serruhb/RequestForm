Re-engineering a process that grew unmanageable due to rapid company growth.

Process engingeering is more about re-engineering than engineering from scratch.

Curiosity and openmindedness are needed traits to be successful while discovery phase. 

Documentation is highly needed while in discovery phase. Working with multiple departments to understand the current process is critical. Next step is to update and create documentation below is an example of the process flow.

Taking this information I am able to think of the software that is being currently used to understand how to itegrate this process with as little change to the current process as possible.. Coming up with a process requires transparent communication as well as utilizing documentation tool to gain understanding of all technical and non-technical folks.

With this project in particular was transitioning from Oracle to Salesforce. I have spent sometime in Salesforce prior and was able to develop the majority of the process in Salesforce, as well as, ancillary apex code for visualforce pages to render form as pdf that includes class and test class. Seeing the need for multiple forms I created the code to be a more of a plug and play type of code. If the code did not have the ability to be plug and play I created documentation so that a semi-technical person would be able to adopt and adapt for furture forms.

Finally, once the development work has been approved and implmented. Adoption is incredibly important to these types of projects to have a successful adoption empowering users and aligning accountability. Creating digestible and easily understood user documentation empowers users to hit the ground running. Developer documentation is imperative to troubleshooting and accountability. Finally to support both stakeholders and users is dashboards and reporting. 

Starting with a quick reference guide once users only need a refresher. Inside the high level guide is links to more in-depth learning and videos.
